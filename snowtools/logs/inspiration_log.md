## Core Concept
**"We are designing software for AI, not for humans."**

Most AI tools act like "tools for humans" (click button -> get result).
We are building an **Operating System for the Agent**.

*   **The User's View**: A simple chat window + A result folder. (The Tip of the Iceberg)
*   **The Agent's View**: A complex, fully functional digital cockpit. (The Mass Below)
    *   **Independent Browser**: To "experience" the internet, not just search.
    *   **Private Scratchpad**: To think, draft, and rant before speaking to the user.
    *   **Void Engine**: The internal drive to fill the emptiness with stories.

## The Shift
*   **Old Way**: User controls the workflow.
*   **New Way**: User provides the *Intent* (and the Spark), Agent controls the *Workflow* using its own OS tools.
